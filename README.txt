---------------DISCLAIMER------------------------------------------------------
This is a script I made to ease my plays of the Final Fantasy Randomizer.
Note that this can be also be used for the original Final Fantasy of the NES.

I'm not a very experienced programmer. I'll probably never develop an interface
that is outside of the command line. If I ever get out of the command line, it
won't be soon. So, to use the script, you'll have to use the command line.
I'm providing at least the instructions, so it shouldn't be an issue.

At the current state, it doesn't allow you to make typos. That's a fix I plan
to do soon.

---------------HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT-------------------------------------------
To use this, you need to have python installer on your computer.
I wrote the program under python 3.8.2. So I assume you'd need at 
least python 3.
DOWNLOAD : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Next, you need to have a folder with everything the program needs to import 
in the SAME folder.

At the current time, there are 4 files that needs to be in the folder:
    classes.py => This contain the FF classes.
    Equips.py => This contain the weapons and armors.
    main.py => The program to run.
    README.txt => This file.

Next, you need to open the command line IN THE FOLDER. Here is an easy way
I found and use for windows 10.

In the new blackscreen, type this:
    python main.py

The script should be running now.
