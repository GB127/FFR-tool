----------------ABOUT----------------------------------------------------------
For the game Final Fantasy of the NES.

This is a script to list the armors and weapons that can be equiped by the classes

I wrote this to help myself in playing the randomizer since I didn't know anything
about the game.

---------------FEATURES--------------------------------------------------------
-> Support any number of classes in your team
-> List weapons only equippable by your team
    -> Their D-H are also displayed
-> List armors only equippable by your team
    -> Their A-E are also displayed
-> Support Ranks up
-> List spells
-> List items
-> List Key Items
    -> Can also track which you have

---------------DISCLAIMER------------------------------------------------------
I'm not a very experienced programmer. I'll probably never develop an interface
that is outside of the command line. So, to use the script, you'll have to use
the command line.
I'm providing at least the instructions, so it shouldn't be an issue.

---------------HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT-------------------------------------------
To use this, you need to have python installer on your computer.
I wrote the program under python 3.8.2. So I assume you'd need at 
least python 3.
DOWNLOAD : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Next, you need to have a folder with everything the program needs to import 
in the SAME folder.

At the current time, there are 4 files that needs to be in the folder:
    main.py => The program to run.
    README.txt => This file.

    affichage.py => This contains stuffs related to the displays
    FFclasses.py => This contain the FF classes.
    Equips.py => This contain the weapons and armors.
    spells.py => This contains infos related to spells

Next, you need to open the command line IN THE FOLDER. Here is an easy way
I found and use for windows 10.

In the new blackscreen, type this:
    python main.py

The script should be running now.


You could also try this, but I have no idea how it works.

Note that I'm a new coder, so codes aren't the best yet. I always plan to
improve the code when I have an idea.
